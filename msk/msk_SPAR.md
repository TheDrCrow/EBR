# Inflammatory Spondyloarthritis

## Imaging [^Baraliakos2016]

[^Baraliakos2016]: Baraliakos X, Braun J. Imaging Scoring Methods in Axial Spondyloarthritis. Rheum Dis Clin N Am 42(2016)663-678 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rdc.2016.07.006

### Findings

Divide Finding and changes into acute vs chronic and Spinal Changes and SIJ. 

| | Acute ('Inflammatory') | Chronic ('Structural') | 
|:---|:---|:---|
| Sacro-Iliac Joints | Bone Marrow Oedema | Fat Metaplasia,  Erosions,  Sclerosis,  Ankylosis |
| Spine | Bone Marrow Oedema in bodies ('Spondylitis').   Bone Marrow Oedema in Facet, Costovertebral, Costotransverse joints ('Arthritis') | Fat Metaplasia,  Sclerosis,  Ankylosis.  | 


### Modality Gold Standards 
**MRI** best for Active Inflammatory changes and for fat metaplasia in chronic change.  
**CT and/or Radiographs** for Erosions and Sclerosis.  
**Radiographs** *still* for New Bone Formation and Ankylosis. 

"In daily practice, recognition of imaging findings is used for diagnosing patients with axSpA, but quantification of these lesions is not necessary."  

## Scoring Systems for Imaging. [^Baraliakos2016]

### Sacro-Iliac Joints 

#### Conventional Radiographs  

##### New York Criteria (1966, modified 1984) [^van der Linden1984]
[^van der Linden1984]: van der Linden S, Valkenburg H et al, Evaluation of diagnostic Criteria for ankylosing spondylitis. Arthritis Rhem 1984;27(4):361-8 

| Grade | Definition |
|:---|:---|
| 0 | Normal |
| 1 | Suspicious changes | 
| 2 | Minimal abnormalities: Small localized areas with erosion or sclerosis, without alteration in the joint width |
| 3 | Unequivocal abnormality: Moderate or advances sacroilitis with 1 or more signs of erosions, sclerosis, widening, joint space narrowing, or partial ankylosis. |
| 4 | Severe changes: Total Ankylosis |

> Modified New York Criteria : Diagnosis of AS based on Grade 2 changes bilaterally or Grade 3 or 4 unilaterally **with** specific clinical symptoms suggestive (ie Inflammatory sounding back pain / limitation in movement of spine.). This could mean a 7 to 10 year wait for a diagnosis.

#### MRI 

*Nearly all* systems for Active inflammation use **Semicoronal STIR** images.  
( post Gd T1fs are an alternative. Signal increase here = Vascularization = thus "osteitis" ).  
Chronic / Structural changes use T1-weighted. 
3-4mm slice thickness.  

#### (Active) Inflammatory Sacroiliac joint lesions.  

Multiple systems most of which preform fairly similarly and even a Gestalt Score of 0-3 per SIJ was good. [^LandeweRB2005]
[^LandeweRB2005]: Landewe R, Herrman K et al Scoring sacroiliac joints by MRI: A multi-reader reliability study. J Rheumatol 2005:32(10):2050-5

Use **Berlin Criteria**:  
Score each quadrant of each SIJ 0 to 3. Based on Bone marrow oedema on STIR 

|  | Grade 0 | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
Bone Marrow Oedema in each quadrant SIJ area | Absent | <33% | 33-66% | >66% | 
> Thus Total score = (4 x 3) x 2 = 0 to 24.
> Note this system avoids conversations about erosions yes or no as a measure of activity or soft tissue change.

#### (Chronic) Structural Sacroiliac joint changes.     

Same applies, here there are multiple systems with slightly different ways of doing this.  
**Berlin Criteria** uses a mixed way of doing this with some dichotomy and some semi-qualitative.

|  | Grade 0 | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
Erosions per quadrant | Absent | Minor (1 or 2) | Moderate (3 to 5) | Multiple (Confluent) |
Fatty Bone Marrow Deposition (FMD) per quadrant | Absent | Present |  
Sclerosis per joint | Absent | Present |
Ankylosis | Absent | Present |
> Thus Total score = ((4 x 3) x 2) + ((4 x 1) x 2) + 1 + 1 = 0 to 64.  
> Which is a dog's breakfast and not at all rational.
> So suggest Jackdaw should use vague total measure of each joint but explicitly stating each of the criteria.  

### Spine 

#### Conventional Radiographs  

Several scoring systems mostly focussed on hyperproliferative aspects in AS and PsA.  
Most use laterals of the Lumbar spine. Some add on Hips or Thoracic spine or AP views. 
Tend to measure using 0-3 scores looking at: 
1. Erosions
2. Squaring 
3. Sclerosis 
4. Syndesmophytes at anterior vertebral edges. 
> Though others will add in posterior edge etc  

#### MRI  

Use 3-4 mm Sag STIR for active disease and Sag T1 for chronic change. 
Post Gd Sat T1fs "no additional benefit for superior assessment of disease activity" [^Baraliakos2016]


#### (Active) Inflammatory Spinal joint lesions. 

Several systems in use. Most have good performance for active disease and change and for reliability.
All but 1 out of 7 looks at the posterior elements for signs of inflammation.
Use **Discovertebral Unit (DVU)** = Bottom 1/2 of vertebral body + Disc + Upper 1/2 of lower vertebral body, starting at C2/3. There are 23 of them.

**Berlin Criteria**  

|  | Grade 0 | Grade 1 | Grade 2 | Grade 3 | 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
Bone Marrow Oedema in DVU area. | Absent | <25% | 25-50% | >50% |  
Bone Marrow Oedema in Posterior Segment per DVU | Absent | Minor | Severe |
> Might just do 0-3 for anterior bodies but only mention if there is stuff in the posterior parts. 


#### (Chronic) Structural Structural joint changes.

Several systems but little in way of usage as plain films are still better.
And can be complicated with ASspiMRI-c producing a scale from 0 to 138. 

But, they still concentrate on:  
1. Fat metaplasia (FMD)
1. Erosion 
1. Syndesmophytes
1. Ankylosis 
> and some include: 
1. Sclerosis
1. Squaring off

## Paediatric Considerations[^Herregods2023]

[^Herregods2023]: Herregods N, Anisau A et al. MRI in Paediatric sacroilitis, what radiologists should know. Pediatric Radiology
https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-023-05602-z 

**Juvenile spondyloarthropathy** = group of related inflammatory disorders, onset in childhood of adolescence.  
Presentation is more with peripheral arthritis and enthesitis of pelvis and leg in early disease and generally SIJitis later in the course.  

"*(SIitis is)..more challenging to diagnose compared with adults due to normal physiological changes.*"[^Herregods2023]  

### Protocol for SIJ MRI.  

Lots of protocols out there (but for adults):
 * ASAS 2009 = Semicoronal T1/STIR.
 * ASAS-SPARTAN 2021. 

But for children there is the: ESSR-ESPR paper for SIitis in JIA[^Hemke2020]

[^Hemke2020]:Hemke R, Herregods N, Jaremko JL et al (2020) Imaging assessment of children presenting with suspected or known juvenile idiopathic arthritis: ESSR-ESPR points to consider. Eur Radiol 30:5237â€“5249

This was: 
 * Semicoronal T1 / STIR ( or fat suppressed T2 )
 * Axial STIR ( or fat suppressed T2 )

 * and optional fat sat T1 post Gd semicoronal and axial.  

 I think it should be: 
    1. Semicoronal STIR 
    1. Semicoronal T1 
    1. Ax STIR of the whole pelvis ( to look at the hips and enthesitis ).

But for structural lesions then a sequence for better optimisation of the bone-cartilage interface is considered important, mostly to look at erosions.  
This might mean T1fs 2D or 3D or perhaps DESS. 

### Imaging Characterisations in Children. 

No paediatric scoring system or agreement like for ASAS or SPARCC or OMERACT for SIJitis 
*"Developing reliable pediatric-specific definition for sacro-ilitis is a difficult task"*

#### Active inflammatory lesions  

Count bone marrow oedema(bmo), joint fluid, joint enhancement, inflammation in an erosion cavity, capsulitis and enthesitis.  
But **Bone marrow oedema** is the key feature for diagnosing SIitis.
