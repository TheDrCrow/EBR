## Anatomy

#### Blumensaat's Line 

**a.k.a. Intercondylar line**  
is the line drawn along the roof of Intercondylar notch of femur on a sagittal view of the knee.  

Not always straight ~ 2/3 have a hill along it.  

Used for: 
1) ACL injury: Blumensaat Angle ( with the ACL ) is <= 15 degrees. 
2) Lateral femoral condyle sulcus ( should be within 10mm )  
3) Post-op ACL reconstruction = see below.   

## Meniscal Repair. 

Often persistent knee pain or clicking etc  
    _can be due to chondral lesion, intra-articular bodies or subchondral insuff fracture etc_

### Normal Post-op Appearances  
Usually menical repairs involve combinations of:  
1) Removal of torn (avascular) parts of inner part.
2) Repair with sutures or bioabsorbable arrows in peripheral part.  

#### Peripheral Zone    
Normal is to see sutures up to about 1yr.   
Can have intermediate signal upto surface up to 1 yr post-op which is due to granulation tissue. 
Post 1yr then this part may return to normal signal. 

#### Central Zone
Post partial meniscectomy then inner border / free edge will have a sharp, truncated and blunted appearance. 
Should be no residual signal reaching surface in this part. 

### Post-op Re-Tear. 
*Always tricky*  
T1 and PD high signal is often granulation tissue thus is indeterminate. 
Re-Tear only diagnosable if: 
1) Definite surface signal on T2. 
2) Displaced meniscal fragment. 
3) Tear at a new site.

Repair of repeated tear utility is uncertain.

~40% prior meniscal surgery knees have associated articular chondral abnormalities.  
And look for intra-articular bodies, synovitis, bone marrow oedema in femoral condyles or tibial plateaus.

## ACL Repair  

Usually use ***Bone-Patellar Tendon-Bone*** from mid section or ***Hamstring Grafts*** from distal semitendinosus and gracilis tendons and need a fixation device at either end.

Representation often due to pain, instability or new ACL injury. 

### ACL Graft Assessment on MRI  
Always assess: 
1) **POSITION**  
    Tibial Tunnel should be just behind Blumensaat's line. 
    Too posterior -> Instability. 
    Too Anterior -> "Roof impingement" of graft on the intercondylar roof. Rad: Degeneration ( thick and high signal in graft ) & bulge posteriorly of the ACL.  

2) **SIGNAL & APPEARANCE** 
    i) < 12-18 months post op: Can have intermediate signal (*revascularization*) especially prominent with Hamstring.
but never fluid signal intensity.   

    ii) >12-18 months post op: Should be low on T1 & T2.  
If not, consider impingement or disruption. 

### Non-ACL Graft Assessment in post ACL repair knee on MRI  
1) Arthrofibrosis  
~ intra-articular scarring. Can be focal or diffuse. 
'Cyclops' Lesion = focal nodular fibrosis in intercondylar notch anterior to graft. Rad: Mixed heterogeneous lesion on T1 & T2.  

2) Tunnel Cysts / Ganglion Cysts 
Can form in or around the osseous tunnels 
CF: Laxity 
Small are ok. Large are not. Enlargement of tunnel is not. (aka "tunnel lysis" or "tunnel expansion")
