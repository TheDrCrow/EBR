### AO - DGOU Classification of OF.

>DGOU = German Society of Orthopaedics. Dr Klaus SCHAKE

Reviewed 700 OFs and found the standard classifications as unhelpful as: 

 - Most Common were A1 and A3, but not quite fitting. 
 - B and C were uncommon.
 - Neuro deficits were rare. (2%) 
 - **But**, progressive kyphosis was common esp with T-score <-3.

And go onto point out that: 

 - As well as fracture morphology being different from healthy bone,
 - Morphology of the fractures seen in these patients does not tell whether they did or did not have a prior trauma.
 - Fractures change over time leading to potential instability.
 - Treatment more a function of prior function and co-morbidities than the fracture itself.
 
 The OF classification is based on simple morphology from plain film, CT and/or MR and goes from 1 to 5 relating to greater instability.   

"*use in all patients with osteoporosis or suspected osteoporosis in all situations*"  
> Osteoporosis defined as < -2.5 on T-score.
