# Spinal Instability Score (SINS)

Simple scoring for Stability in Malignant Infiltration.

### Scoring System.

[^Fisher2014]: Fisher CG et al. AJR Am J Roentgenol 2014 Oct;203(4):869-74. doi: 10.2214/AJR.13.12269.  

![SINS Classification](images/msk_spine_SINS) [^Fisher2014]

Scored out of 18.
 - 0 to 6: Stable. 
 - 7 to 12: Potentially Unstable.
 - 13 to 18: Unstable.  

So 7 and above needs Spinal Surgeon discussion.

### How good is it? 

Most papers seem to be about intra and interobserver reliability.
