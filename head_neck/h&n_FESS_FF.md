# Sinus / FESS CT 

## FESS CT Report [^Deutschmann2013] [^Hoang2009] [^Vaid2011] [^Mamluk2018]

**Glastonbury** states 5 main parts of a report. 

1. Sinus Opacification and Disease.  
2. Sinus Drainage Pathways.
3. Anatomical Variants. 
4. Critical Variants.
5. State of other regions. 

### Normal Mucosa:

= <4mm in Maxillary Sinus, <2mm in Ethmoid Sinus & Nose. Generally not seen in the Frontal or sphenoids in healthy patients

### Post- Operative:

Focus on Frontal drainage pathway and its patency:
? lateralisation of the middle turbinate.
? persistent frontal recess cells.
	Assess completeness of uncinatomy and ? whether it is too far posterior. 
	Assess extent of ethmoidectomy +/- any post-op synechiae ⇒ obstructed sinus drainage.
	Persistent sinus opacification ? due to viscous secretions. 
	Assess integrity of the middle turbinate attachment to the anterior skull base. - ? dehiscence
	? any defect in the lamina papyracea.

### Lund & Mackay Scoring System for CRS. 

0 = Absent or No opacification 
1 = Partial Opacification.  
2 = Complete Opacification.  
> Stuart Viner (Lecture at BSHNI 2022): Do not count minor mucosal thickening. 'Complete opacification' is 100%! not 90%. 

And scored on: 
Frontal  Sinuses : RIGHT & LEFT. 
Anterior Ethmoid : RIGHT & LEFT. 
Posterior Ethmoid: RIGHT & LEFT.
Maxillary Sinuses: RIGHT & LEFT.
Sphenoid Sinuses : RIGHT & LEFT.
Ostiomeatal Units: RIGHT & LEFT. (0 = Unopacified, 2 = Opacified.)

Thus, Scored from 0-24.

#### Variants on Lund-Mackay.  
*Pediatric Sinus Scoring System*[^Melder2021]
3 differences: 
1. Assess each station as A = Absent, U = Underdeveloped or D = Developed.  
Absents always score 0. Underdeveloped score 0.5 x score.  
2. Score is still 0, 1 or 2 but now 0-25% = 0, 25-75% = 1, >75% = 2.  
3. The OMU is still scored the same but as the denominator can vary, it is adjusted by multiplication factor so that it is divided by 24 to make it comparable with the Lund-Mackay score.

*Zinreich*   
Better for overall disease burden but more long-winded.  

Score 0 - 5 rather than 0-2 for each sinus   
and OMU = 0, 1 or 2.   
So, can score up to 54.

## Development and Paediatric Consideration.

### Lund & Mackay Score in Paediatric Chronic Rhinosinusitis Diagnosis  

Bizarrely there is a small, reasonable conducted trial demonstrating that it does, compared with 'normals undergoing sinus CT for other reasons.'[^Bhattachrayya2004]  

And, they say a cut of for the diagnosis of CRS vs Normal is 5 or 6.

Whilst <2 is ~ 100% NPV.  
And, >10 is ~ 100% PPV.

But, the score does not appear to differentiate the degree of improvement in symptoms post FESS [^Bhattachrayya2006].

### Development. [^Melder2021] 

Sinuses appear, generally in order of Ethmoids, Maxillary, Sphenoids then Frontal.  
So at 7-11yrs: Absent or Underdeveloped:[^Melder2021] 
 - Frontal = 50%  
 - Sphenoids = 30%
 - Maxillary = 20% 
 - Ethmoids underdevelopment is unusual. 

 *Shah* Criteria for Full Development. [^Shah2003] 
> ie the sinus would be considered as D = Developed once it has reached these criteria. 

 - Frontal = Extends superiorly (sic) to the vertical portion of the Frontal bone.
 - Maxillary = Extends inferiorly below the nasal floor and laterally as far as the zygomatic process.
 - Ethmoids = Extend superiorly to the level of the cribiform plate.
 - Sphenoids = Extend laterally and superior to the optic structs.
