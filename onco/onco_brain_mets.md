# Brain Mets 

## Parenchyma, leptomeninges, pachymeninges and skull. 

### General [^Sahdev] 

[^Sahdev]: Sahdev A and Vinnicombe S. Husband & Resnek Imaging in Oncology. CRC Press 2020. 

10 Brain Mets : 1 Primary Brain Tumour.   
30% of brain mets present as solitary lesion.

**Incidence:** 14 per 100K py (Sweden 2006). Increasing due to improved management of primary disease and more x-sectional on the dying. Note increased risk of brain mets relapse in Herceptin treated patients.  

**Prognosis:** Very poor  
Median survival in WBRT treated cohort from unsorted tumours  
 - 3.4 months 
 - OS 
    = 6% at 2 yrs
    = 2% at 5 yrs  

### Table 

Primary | Freq | Site | Skull Mets | Pachymeningeal | Lepto / CSF | Radiology 
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
Breast | 15% | Cerebellum / Post.Fossa | 50% of calvarial | 34% are Breast | ++ | |
Lung | 17% | Parietal / Occipital | | 13% are lung | ++ | |  
Renal | 11% | | | | | | 
Melanoma | 8% | | | | + | |
Prostate | | | 40% of skull base | 17% are prostate | | |
Lymphoma | | | 8% of skull base | | +++ | | 
H+N | | | | 10% are H+N | | | 
> Renal incidence seems too high and breast / lung too low for Worthing.  

### Parenchymal Mets  
Usually at grey-white matter interface or watersheds  
 - 80% Cerebral hemispheres
 - 15% Cerebellum 
 - 5% Basal Ganglia  

Nearly 50% are solitary especially Renal / GI / Urogynae.
Multiple tend to be Breast / Lung / Melanoma

**Haemorrhage:**
 - Melanoma (and melanin is paramagnetic) 
 - Thyroid 
 - Renal  

**Calcification:**
 - Lung 
 - Breast 
 - CRC 

**Vasogenic Oedema:**
 - Lung >>
 - Breast > 
 - Oesophageal
 > Don't forget PCNSL

### Pachymeningeal Mets 

aka *Dural* mets.  
Prognosis is good at 2x that of parenchymal & leptomeningeal mets  
~ 34% invade underlying brain. ( ~50% of these have vasogenic oedema )
~ 44% of dural mets have 'dural tail' sign.  
Most are frontal and parietal. 

### Leptomeningeal 

MRI >> CT  
FLAIR + T1 post Gd (volumes).  
NB: Look at the CN for enhancement. 
**Site**: (in frequency order)
 1. Cerebellum 
 1. Occipital lobe  
 1. VII / VIII CNs  
 1. Lateral Ventricle ependymal surfaces. 

## Approach to Solitary lesion. 

30% present as Solitary lesions.  

1) Mets vs Primary: Look at periphery as it is cells + oedema in a primary vs just oedema in a met. But there are no very clear answers from the use of advanced imaging.
2) Met/Primary vs Abscess: ADC especially in centre is useful in cystic / ring enhancing lesions as low ADC is relatively maintained in abscesses. But GBM can be low ADC 
3) High Grade Glioma vs Met: is very difficult.  

All advanced imaging has inconsistent findings in reviews of literature.  

## Post-Treatment Change. 

**Pseudo-progression** is a thing post SRS (and other ones as well),
6 to 78 weeks Post-Treatment
Seen in UP TO 1/3
Better prognosis with 2 months increase in OS  

Signs of Pseudo-progression, include: 
 - Increase size of lesion.
 - Central decrease T2. 
 - Blurred peripheral enhancement. 
 - Increase perilesional oedema.
