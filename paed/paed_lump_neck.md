### If the lump is a lymph node. 

Consider: 
1. Palpable lymph nodes are normal. [^Alves_Rosa2021] [^Paddock2020]
1. Persistent normal nodes are normal in children. [^Meadows2020]
1. Lymph nodes varying in size is normal.
1. US is of limited utility in differentiating the different causes of lymphadenopathy.[^Paddock2020]
1. If there are features suggestive of a lymphoma then please refer as per [NICE NG12](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng12/chapter/recommendations-organised-by-symptom-and-findings-of-primary-care-investigations#symptoms-in-children-and-young-people)
1. If the concern is leukaemia or other malignancy then please refer as per [NICE NG12](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng12/chapter/recommendations-organised-by-symptom-and-findings-of-primary-care-investigations#symptoms-in-children-and-young-people).

If still wanting to refer then just guide to a non-ordered input.

Use the usual non-ordered inputs.
